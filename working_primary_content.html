<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to see how your current deployment was treating you. As our customers engage in research to determine if our high-value, low-cost solutions will be a good fit, I wanted to reach out regarding how SolarWinds can assist with any of your current projects or requirements.</p>

<p>Since your last purchase, we have released a myriad of new features and products to meet the unique needs of our clients. If you would like a technical refresh with one of my Engineers, or should you need to add capacity to any of your modules, please let me know. 
Moving into the spring, I have been authorized some discount incentives for my team to provide to those with near-term projects. If you would like any further information, I would be happy to assist.</p>


<p>Thank you and I hope to work with you again soon.</p>
